Version: v3.2.9
Updated at: 2025-06-03 03:18:22 UTC
Release Notes:
# Sanction Rules
Added to routing rules to provide a more stable and solid connection for websites which applied sanctions and are not blocked by ISP.
You can set a desired DNS and choose preset rules or custom rules for bypassing. This feature makes WorkerLess config a special config which not only can access most of blocked addresses but also can bypass sanctions.

> [!CAUTION]
> Please avoid using `Bypass Google` pre-set rule (unless you are a pro and know what's happening), it conflicts a wide range of addresses which may conflict with your proxy settings and leads to malfunctioning sometimes. It's recommended to fill your single desired addresses in custom rules section instead.
